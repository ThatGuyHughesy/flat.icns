# About this fork

This is a [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) of the original repository by Tina Latif.
I have made this fork, to keep the project alive and up to date with icons for new apps.

I have tried to make the project more generic, by replacing the Adobe Illustrator files with svg files. Which makes it easier for people without Creative Cloud to contribute.
Some new scripts have been added to make it easier to convert svg files to icns and png, see [contributing](https://github.com/viktorstrate/flat.icns#contribute).

# Installation

## Method 1: Automated script
The fastest way to install the icons, is using the `install.sh` script.

Follow these steps to install, using automated script.

1) Download the iconpack [here](https://github.com/viktorstrate/flat.icns/archive/master.zip), or by clicking `Clone or download` -> `Download ZIP`
2) Open `Terminal`, by searching for it with Spotlight (`âŒ˜`+`Space`).
3) Drag 'n drop `install.sh`, from the downloaded folder, to the `Terminal` window.
4) Press enter to start installation

To restore the icons, run `./install.sh restore`

## Method 2: Icon Manager

There are a few icon managers out there. I use and recommend [LiteIcon](http://www.freemacsoft.net/liteicon).

Just drag and drop the icons onto their corresponding applications, and then log out and back in to refresh the dock.

## Method 3: Manual installation

Some programs may require manual installation (for example, if they are not directly in the Applications folder). The icns folder contains all the .icns files for this.

1. Find the .icns file for the program
2. Navigate to the program
3. Right-click on the program and select 'Get Info'
4. Drag the .icns file onto the existing icon for the program in the info panel

### To install the Calender app:
1. Choose which icons you want to use from the flaticns folder and change the names to 'App.icns' and 'App-empty.icns' by right-clicking and selecting 'Get Info'
2. Go to Applications, right click on the Calendar app, and select "Show Package Contents"
3. Navigate to Calendar.app/Contents/Resources to find the 'App.icns' and the 'App-empty.icns' (recommended to make a back-up of these!)
4. Drag the .icns files from the flaticns folder into the Calendar app's to overwrite it.
5. Navigate to Calendar.app/Contents/Resources/Calendar.docktileplugin/Contents/Resources
6. Repeat step 4
7. Go to terminal and enter "killall Dock" to refresh your dock


# Requests

If you want an icon that's not there, the preferred way of requesting is to file an issue for it.

You are more than welcome to send a pull request with a new icon, see [contribute](https://github.com/viktorstrate/flat.icns#contribute).

# Contribute

## Step 1: Making icons
If you want to add icons, I've provided some [templates](https://github.com/viktorstrate/flat.icns/tree/master/templates) for the size.
Use the red as a guideline for centered icons.

## Step 2: Saving and generating required files
Before you can send a pull request, you must generate a 1024x1024 size PNG image, and a ICNS file, these image files are required to install the icon pack.

1. Save the icon to `./vectors` as an svg file.

2. Generate required files, by running `./build.sh -ai` from the terminal. You might need some dependencies for the script to work.

The easiest way to install the dependencies is by using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), which you can install from their website. After installing Homebrew run the following command from the terminal.

```shell
brew install imagemagick libicns
```
